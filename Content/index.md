## Welcome to my App development blog
&nbsp;

### My name is **[Sebastian Vieira](https://twitter.com/seviu)**
&nbsp;

I have been developing mobile apps since 2003 that I started with Nokia's Symbian OS and J2ME. That quickly changed in 2008 that the App Store was introduced and changed everything.

I try to combine my passion for the Swift programming language and being a father. This is how Swiftdaddy was born. 

I live in Switzerland where I work as an iOS developer for an awesome company [homegate.ch](https://homegate.ch). I have also had the privilege to work for Swisscom at [local.ch](https://local.h) and a few Swiss Startups.

Finally, I am with my friend and awesome developer [Vikram Kriplaney](https://markiv.github.io/blog/), co-founder of [iPhonso GmbH](https://iphonso.com), a Swiss app development company for which we develop fun and interesting apps.
